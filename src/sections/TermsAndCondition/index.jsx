          <div>
            <h4>Where we Ship</h4>
            <p>
              We ship to any physical address that the shipper/courier can ship to. We may
              accommodate Customers who need to have an item shipped to an APO/FPO address or PO Box
              depending on the circumstances. Customers also acknowledge that Ironside Computers is
              not liable for providing the customs and import policies of their country. Ironside
              Computers is not responsible for any fees or taxes associated with international
              shipments. The customer is responsible for being aware of the customs policies in
              their place of residence.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>When we Ship</h4>
            <p>
              Products are shipped only after build which can take up to 10 days on a standard
              basis. Your order may be delayed if your ship to address does not match what your
              credit card issuer has on their file. Some orders that are shipped from fulfillment
              warehouses may require longer for the item to ship. We may also ship the orders with
              multiple items from different warehouses so it is possible you get the items on
              different days. Due to the many circumstances such as unable to charge your card or
              verify your address, we cannot guarantee when your order is shipped out. Also if you
              choose next day air service, it does not necessarily mean you will get it the next day
              from the order date, it means that you will get it the next day from the date we ship
              the order. Ironside Computers reserves the right at any time after receipt of your
              order to delay your order for any reason.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Shipping Delays</h4>
            <p>
              Once an order is shipped, it is up to the shipper courier to deliver the products; we
              will not be able to stop the shipment once it is shipped. If the shipper/courier loses
              the package, the shipper courier will put a tracer on the package. Tracers take around
              3 days for air packages and 7 business days for ground packages. We will not be able
              to ship out replacement packages until the shipper courier confirms that the package
              is lost/will not be delivered to its destination and they will reimburse us. Without
              confirmation from the shipper courier, we will not know for sure if you will get two
              shipments if we ship out another one. Another delay is if there is no one to sign for
              the package, every package we ship usually requires a signature, if a package is
              returned to us because no one was available to sign for it or the address was input
              incorrectly at the time you enter the order, you will be charged again to ship it out
              a second time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Order Acceptance Policy</h4>
            <p>
              Your receipt of an electronic or phone order confirmation does not signify our
              acceptance of your order. Ironside Computers reserves the right at any time after
              receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.
            </p>

            <h4>DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS TO PRODUCTS SOLD.</h4>

              stick causing stability/performance issues. Any custom work done on the computer such
